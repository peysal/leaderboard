leaderboard
===========

Some of the things implemented:
Make a button that toggles between sorting by score and sorting by name. 
Make a button that resets everyone's score to a random number. 
Implement a way to add and remove scientists from the leaderboard.

This is based on https://www.meteor.com/examples/leaderboard
